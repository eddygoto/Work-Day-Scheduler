# Work-Day-Scheduler

homework 5

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a functioning work day scheduler that included an 8 hour planner wherein I could save plans for the day, a time clock, and time blocks that displayed past, present and future times. Working with JQuery was definitely something that I had to get used to. There was a lot of different documentation and I found myself having to refer back to the website multiple times in order to get everything to work correctly. The only major difficulty I had working with this project was creating the time block function, as figuring out a way to assign the time to each individual block wasn't something we'd ever encountered before. However, I came out of this project happy with the results.
